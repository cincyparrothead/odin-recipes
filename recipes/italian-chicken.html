    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the easiest Italian chicken recipes: Boneless breasts marinated in Italian-style salad dressing, then baked. It's the simplest and most delicious meal ever</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour salad dressing into a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, seal bag, and shake to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight (the longer you marinate, the more flavor the chicken will absorb).</li><br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish; discard remaining marinade.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning chicken occasionally, until cooked through and juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
